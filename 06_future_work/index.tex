\chapter{Future Work}

\section{Actual 'Multi'-FPGA System}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about how a system with 3+ FPGAs would look, the necessity of adding an address signal to the interconnect
\end{itemize}

\section{General HLS Optimizations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding pipelining, FIFOs, arrays and maybe even giving the user access to FPGA pins
    \item Maybe even the off-chip function can start to use FPGA pins
\end{itemize}

\section{Inter-FPGA Data Streaming}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Potentially you could stream data through the channel in order to get more than two operands across.
    \item You could also split the channel into two. One for starting off-chip functions and one for streaming data between the FPGAs.
\end{itemize}
