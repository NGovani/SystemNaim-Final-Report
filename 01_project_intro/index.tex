\chapter{Project Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce aim of project: To prove it is possible to create a multi-fpga system through an HLS Tool.
    \item There are benefits to completing the aim above and that will be explored later
    \item Maybe talk about the fact that the HLS part isn't that important to the investigation. Likely to introduce the concept and then elaborate further in the design section.
    \item Also talk about what contributions we are aiming to achieve:
    \item Split below into two parts, one is project aims/objetives (questions) and one into what was actually accomplished and produces
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HLS tools make it easier for users to create dedicated hardware.
        \item It is possible to automate the process of creating a multi-FPGA system and integrate it into a HLS tool
        \item This automated process can provide a performance boost and does not add too much of an overhead.
        \item In summary, we can make it easier for people to create a multi-FPGA system, thus allowing people who could benefit from such a thing(Researches, ...?), to do so without requiring an exorbitant amount of extra man-power.
        \item The hls tool is a platform for Researches
        \item the interconnect
